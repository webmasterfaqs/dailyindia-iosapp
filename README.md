# DailyIndia iOS App

This repository contains the skeleton for the **DailyIndia** news application.

## Getting Started

1. Open `DailyIndia.xcodeproj` (create if it doesn't exist yet).
2. Build and run the **DailyIndia** scheme on the iOS simulator or device.

The current project provides empty stubs for services, view models and views.
Use them as starting points for implementing the app features.
